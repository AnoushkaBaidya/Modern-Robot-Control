# Modern-Robot-Control 

The repository includes the design of a robot controller for a 2-link robot arm simulated in Gazebo and Matlab. The controller design process starts from feedback linearization controller deisgn and progresses to partial feedback linearization, as well as robust and adaptive controller design.

The design of control algorithm is such that it can track a desired trajectory even in the presence of dynamic model uncertainties and stabilize itself at the upward equilibrium point.
